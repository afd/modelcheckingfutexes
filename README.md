# modelcheckingfutexes

Promela models of futex-based synchronisation primitives.

The relevant Promela code is in the `promela` subdirectory. See
comments for examples on how to use Spin with these files.

The `cpp` subdirectory contains C++ samples based on code from
Drepper's "Futexes Are Tricky" paper and Denis-Courmont's ["Condition
variable with futex"](https://www.remlab.net/op/futex-condvar.shtml)
article.
